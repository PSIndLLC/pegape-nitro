# pegape-nitro
Installation script to enable Linux and OSX installation of Pega Infinity Personal Edition on operating systems
other than MS Windows. This eliminates the unnecessary overhead incurred by MS Windows and allows for MacBooks
to run a PegaPE package as provided by Pegasystems without also acquiring additional MS Windows licensing.

This package does not provide a copy of the Pega Infinity Personal Edition software nor does it provide or 
alter licensing for the same, which must be otherwise acquired directly from Pegasystems
